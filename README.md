# 4-bit-ALU-Implementation
Simple Arithmetic Logic Unit Implementation in VHDL using Quartus Prime. The arithmetic part is the full-adder and logical part consists of AND, OR and XOR Gate. The output from the adder and the gates are multiplexed using a 4x1 MUX. For the VHDL implementation, the concept of port mapping is used.
